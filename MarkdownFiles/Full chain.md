# Extracted Information

## Answer

For the Boeing 737-8 MAX, the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) for the pitot heater is as follows:

- **Left/Right Pitot Heaters**: One may be inoperative for day VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions) provided:
  - The auxiliary pitot heater operates normally.
  - The airplane is not operated in visible moisture.
  - The airplane is not operated in known or forecast icing conditions.

- **Auxiliary Pitot Heater (Right Lower Probe)**: May be inoperative provided:
  - Both left and right pitot heaters operate normally.
  - The airplane is not operated in known or forecast icing conditions.

**Maintenance (M) Procedure**:
1. Verify that the probe heater operates normally prior to each departure.
2. Ensure covers are removed from all air data probes and vanes.
3. Supply electrical power to the airplane.
4. Position the associated PITOT STATIC HEAT switch or PROBE HEAT switch to the ON position.
5. Verify that heat radiation can be detected from the associated probe, indicating that the heater is functioning.
6. Position the associated PITOT STATIC HEAT switch or PROBE HEAT switch to the OFF or AUTO position.
7. Restore the airplane's electrical system to normal.

 | C | 4 | 2 | (O)

One loop (A or B) per engine may be inoperative provided remaining operative loops are verified to operate normally once each flight day.
OPERATIONS (O)
Verify normal operation of the remaining operative loops once each flight day using the FCOM Supplementary Procedure - Fire Protection “Fire and Overheat System Test with an Inoperative Loop“ (Refer to the Flight Crew Operations Manual).
NOTE 1:Dispatch is not allowed if both loops A and B are inoperative on one engine.
NOTE 2:When performing the Flight Crew Operations Manual Supplementary Procedures - Engines, APU “Battery Start” procedure, the fire warning bell may not sound and the master FIRE WARN lights may not illuminate.

 | D | 4 | 3 | (M)

Any in excess of those required may be inoperative or missing provided:
a. Inoperative fire extinguisher is tagged inoperative, removed from installed location, and placed out of sight so it can not be mistaken for a functional unit.
b. Required distribution is maintained.
NOTE 1:When Used, fire extinguisher is considered Inoperative.
NOTE 2:A Water Fire Extinguisher is installed in AFT Galley area, above RH C/A seat.
NOTE 3:As specified on CAT.IDE.A.250, there should be at least one hand fire extinguisher installed in the flight crew compartment and this should be suitable for fighting both flammable fluid and electrical equipment fires.
NOTE 4:On new aircraft from YT287 and onwards, an extra H20 Fire Extinguisher is installed in Compartment G7.
NOTE 5:Refer to AOC specific pages under Maintenance (M) Items of this MEL for further guidance on who may complete MAINTENANCE (M) procedures applicable to this ATA.
MAINTENANCE (M)
1. Stow the out-of-service extinguisher in a place (possibly in a bag) where it will not be used by mistake until it can be removed from the airplane.
2. Ensure required distribution of serviceable extinguishers is maintained throughout the airplane.

 | C | 1 | 0 | (M)

May be inoperative provided:
a. Wheel well fire detection system is deactivated.
b. Brake temperature monitoring system (BTMS) operates normally.
MAINTENANCE (M)
Deactivate the wheel well fire detection system using one of the following procedures (AMM 26-00-00/901).
1. Option 1: Deactivate WHEEL WELL light and wheel well fire detection system input to fire warning system.
A. Remove the two light bulbs from the WHEEL WELL light on the P8-1 panel and placard the light and the associated WHEEL WELL light switch.
B. Disconnect the fire bell:
1) Remove Flight Control Computer B to get access to the wiring for the fire bell (AMM TASK 22-11-33-000-801).
2) Disconnect the wires from D742, pin 16 and pin 25 on the E1-4 shelf.
3) Cap and stow the wires.
4) Reinstall Flight Control Computer B (AMM TASK
22-11-33-400-801).
5) Placard the master FIRE WARN lights on the P1 panel to indicate that the fire warning associated with the wheel well is inoperative.
2. Option 2: Deactivate the detection elements of the wheel well fire detection system.
A. Disconnect the terminal lugs or connectors on both sides of the M270 detection elements.
B. Perform the OVHT/Fire Warning System Operational Test per AMM 26-18-00
All tests should pass except for the wheel well fire function with the disabled element.
C. Stow the wiring and terminal lugs on either side of M270 detection elements.

 | May be inoperative provided:
 | a. Wheel well fire detection system is deactivated.
 | b. Landing gear remain extended for ten minutes after takeoff.
 | c. Appropriate performance adjustments are applied.
 | NOTE: In case of engine failure after V1, performance is prime consideration, |  |  | 

and landing gear should be retracted normally until performance penalty with gear down is not a problem.
Pilots must consider possibility of ice accumulation on gear associated with delayed raising of landing gear or lowering landing gear during winter operations.
